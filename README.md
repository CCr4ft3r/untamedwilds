                    Untamed Wilds

Untamed Wilds is an open-source mod that aims to expand the exploration component of Minecraft through the introduction of high-quality, animated mobs with interesting AI
	 
General Features:
* All mobs/features are created as part of Worldgen, this is a deliberate choice to provide meaningful consequences to player's actions
* Untamed Wilds mobs do not despawn. Ever. They also will not respawn (outside of breeding)
* All mobs featured in this list encompass a multitude of Species; Species are dynamically assigned to each Biome depending on it's basic features from a list of weighted entries, this choice provides compatibility out of the box with any Biome mod.
* Smaller mobs can be picked up by hand (Right-Click the mob with an empty hand) to ease their transportation, larger mobs can be transported by using Cage Traps. 
* While the default parameters aim to be "believable", a plethora of Config options allow the user to replicate Vanilla behaviours (such as breeding being triggered through the favourite item)
* A very WIP guidebook is provided through [Patchouli] (book + any piece of hide). All content has been generated from the data in the 'lang' file, and is a heavy WIP. All current data is sourced from Wikipedia and has been processed through the NLTK Python library.
