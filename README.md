                    Untamed Wilds

Untamed Wilds is an open-source mod that aims to expand the exploration component of Minecraft through the introduction of high-quality, animated mobs with interesting AI
	 
General Features:
* All mobs/features are created as part of Worldgen, this is a deliberate choice to provide meaningful consequences to player's actions
* Untamed Wilds mobs do NOT despawn. Ever. They also will not respawn (outside of breeding)
* All mobs featured in this list encompass a multitude of Species; Species are dynamically assigned to each Biome depending on it's biome type, this choice provides compatibility out of the box with any Biome mod, but may sometimes misplace species.
* Smaller mobs can be picked up by hand (Right-Click the mob with an empty hand) to ease the transportation. 
* While the default parameters aim to be "realistic", a plethora of Config options are provided to replicate Vanilla behaviours (such as breeding being triggered through the favourite item)
* A WIP guidebook is provided through [Patchouli], this is by no means complete and is lacking basic information, thus, it is only available in the Creative inventory
